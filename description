smtphotel is a docker container that implements a simple mail server for
development use.  It includes an SMTP server that never forwards e-mail or sends
bounces/double bounces (all mail rejection must be done at SMTP time).  It
implements a simple, robust web interface that uses the REST API as the backend,
the web interface should be simple but a joy to use and have reasonable
ability to show the e-mail bodies and headers.  The REST API should allow access
to the underlying mail storage so that tests and the like can access messages to
determine the results of test mail sends.  The mail server should accept e-mail
addressed to any address and store it in the mail store.  Mail should be stored
in a sqlite message store.  Configuration options for pruning the message store
should include deleting messages by age and by message count.
